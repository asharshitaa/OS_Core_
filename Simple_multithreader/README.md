# SimpleMultithreader

# Functions used
- parallel_for (One-Dimensional): Executes a task on a range of numbers using multiple threads, dividing the range across the threads.
- parallel_for (Two-Dimensional): Executes a task on a grid (rows and columns) using multiple threads, dividing the work across threads for each row-column combination.
- demonstration: Shows how to pass and run small tasks (lambda functions) directly.
- Output shows total execution time for each call of a parallel_for in milliseconds.

# How to run it
1. make
2. ./vector
3. ./matrix
(given two test cases)
